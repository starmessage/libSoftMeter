## SoftMeter DLLs calling conventions for Windows
To ease the life of the Windows applications developer, the SoftMeter DLLs have both __cdecl and __stdcall calling conventions.  

The DLLs contain the SoftMeter API functions twice.  
One set is declared with the __cdecl calling convention and the other set with __stdcall.  


E.g
- start()  
- start_stdcall()  
Functions following the __stdcall calling convention, which is the default calling convention for the Win32 API.
- start_cdecl()  
The same function, following the __cdecl calling convention.  
See the example of the [dumpbin report](https://github.com/starmessage/libSoftMeter/blob/master/bin/dumpbin-of-softmeter-dll.txt) of SoftMeter.

Depending on the language of your Windows application you can call either set of functions.
